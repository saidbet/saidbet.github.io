    "summary": "I have a very good knowledge of Unity and React and I understand and adapt very quickly to any project or technology. I had initially started as a Unity Developer with no prior experience in front-end and back-end development, but I quickly adapted for the needs of my client and I have now been working with react for half a year. I integrated multiple new functionnalities to their platform by updating both the front-end and the backend which is made with ASP.net and Entity Framework. I am currently working for my client on maintaining and adding new features to Hakobio (Unity WebGL builder communicating with a react web interface), Hakobio-Holo (unity) and Hakobio-VR (unity).",
